# SLS handler factory

Some helpers for easily manage AWS Lambda handlers creation.

### Prerequisites

Requires aws-sdk package (if executed in AWS Lambda, it is already installed).

```
npm install --save-dev aws-sdk
```

### Usage

The main class is `HandlerFactory`, this is a handlers factory, and adds some sugar, as an event emitter, async callbacks and simple async handler manage.

```typescriptÂº
import {HandlerFactory} from 'sls-handler-factory';
const factory = new HandlerFactory();
factory.eventEmitter.on('error', (err) => console.log(err.stack));
factory.callbacks.onSucceeded(async () => {
	// Here you can handle infrastructure, e.g. here you could persist the domain state.
});
export const handle = factory.build(async (input, ctx) => {
	// Here lies your domain logic.
});
```

## npm scripts

```
npm run build
```
